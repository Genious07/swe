I didnt have that much money to pay at that time to him so i made a trade. I said i will give you my id in exchange for Eshene and when i will get the money i will pay him more then he did and get my id back, after he realised that this id was worth it he accepted the offer.I exchanged the id and it was mixed feeling for me that i got your id back but then again i will not be able to play with you if i didnt got my id back but ok that happend , i got your id in my hand and i was so happy . Now the hard part starts for me , he litrally said i have one month to get my ID back so yeah , had to get somthing and some money , along side with my job i picked up a freelance project of company so dw about it i did it got money and paid him 30% more as i promised but yeah now at this point of time i have our ids with us and now you know why i said i cant play genshin but dw now everything is good , i am happy that i am able get it for you and please dw its ok. I did it because i love you and thats it , Please take it as a gift(Hugs) ')
